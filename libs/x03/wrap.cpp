// [1] Major issue:
//
// In `child` and `createChild`, we use reference_internal so that the child
// keeps alive `self` (that is, the parent node).
//
// This is at least better than the default (rvp::automatic) which would
// instead fallback to move/copy for lvalue references, which in our case would
// fail at runtime because we've disabled copy and move. We'd get errors like
// this issued by pybind11:
//
// RuntimeError: return_value_policy = copy, but type Node is non-copyable!
//
// However, even if it's better than the default doesn't mean it's great: we
// would instead prefer to keep alive the whole tree, not just the parent node!
// In some cases, we might be lucky since the parent keeps alive the parent,
// that keeps alive the parent, etc... and the root keeps alive the tree. But
// this assumes that Python has seen all of these as variables, and that they
// are still around.
//
// Perhaps more importantly, pybind11 only apply the policies when the object
// is first seen by pybind11. So it wouldn't work at all in case of reparenting
// the node or moving the nodes from one tree to another. See the Note after
// the table at
// https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/functions.html#return-value-policies:
//
//   One important aspect of the above policies is that they only apply to
//   instances which pybind11 has not seen before, in which case the policy
//   clarifies essential questions about the return valueâ€™s lifetime and ownership.
//   When pybind11 knows the instance already (as identified by its type and address
//   in memory), it will return the existing Python object wrapper rather than
//   creating a new copy.
//
// [2] Also, by default, the methods returning weak_ptr wouldn't work, you'd
// see the error below. This is why we need to explicitly cast them. In this
// experiment (x03), we choose to convert them to SharedPtr. In x04, we attempt
// to keep them as WeakPtr.
